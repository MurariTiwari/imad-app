<p>Earlier the name of Ranchi District was Lohardaga. The old district had come into existence after the creation of the non-regulation South - West frontier as a result of the Kol rising in 1831-32. The name of the district was changed in 1899 from Lohardaga to Ranchi after the name of a small village now comprised within the headquarters station.

<p>In ancient times the tract which corresponds to the district of Ranchi and the neighouring parganas was in the undisturbed possession of Munda and Oraon Tribes and was known to Aryans as Jharkhand or the 'forest territory'. The entire tract was presumably beyond the pale of the direct Hindu influence in ancient India. However, Jarasandh, the mighty emperor of Rajgriha in the Mahabharat period might have exercised some kind of loose supervision over the area. Similarly, Magapadmand Agrasen of Magadh, who subdued the entire country upto Orissa , might have gained some control over Jharkhand as well.
